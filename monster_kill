implement a function kill_monsters(monster_health[],monster_bonus[],initial_power) 
that returns the number of monsters defeated.

You can only kill a monster whose health is less than your current power
After killing a monster, your power increases by the bonus awarded on that monster


Ex. kill_monster([6,1,3],[1,1,1],2) -> 2

First with power 2 you can only kill monster #2 and get 1 bonus point
new power = 2+1
Next kill monster #3 and get 1 bonus point
new power = 3+1
Now you have 4 power but monster #1 has health of 6 so we can not defeat it.
